Coursera R programming air quality project 
The air qualities were monitored and stored in multiple csv documents, each recording  the values of the sulfate and nitrate together with the time when the data were collected. Some of the data were missing. 

The R script loops over the documents and callulates the values of the pollutants within a certain period.
